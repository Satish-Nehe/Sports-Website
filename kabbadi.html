      <dt>What is Kabbadi ?</dt>
      <dd>
        <em><b>Kabaddi</b></em> is a contact team sport played between two teams
        of seven players, originating in ancient India.[4] The objective of the
        game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to
        run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of
        their players as possible, and return to their own half of the court,
        all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are
        scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team
        earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game
        if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point
        scored by their team from a tag or tackle.
