    <h4>Criect Information</h4>
    <p>
     <strong>Cricket</strong> is a <em>bat-and-ball</em> game that is played between two teams of eleven
      players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre;
      66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
      balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker
      and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one
      player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the
      striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is
      to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the
      nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs
      are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field
      or when the ball is bowled illegally.
